### Progress 

I submitted a proposal for review to the [London Institute for Space Policy and Law](https://ials.sas.ac.uk/about/leadership-and-collaboration/london-institute-space-policy-and-law-ispl). Hoping to eventually pursue a PhD through the University of London's [Institute of Advanced Legal Study](https://ials.sas.ac.uk/study).

Came back with feedback saying the proposal has promise but it's too broad/focused on information policy more than space policy. 

Rethinking and considering applying to U Buffalo's Information Science PhD instead... TBD.
