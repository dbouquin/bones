### Ideas for scope:

International legal/ethical/policy/security implications of...

1.  different software license choices in small sat context

	* Private companies
	* Public/gov funded missions
	* amateur development
	* Hardware licensing?

What should we recommend (e.g. MetaSat's recommended license for payload telemetry decoders)? -- "open" is vague.

2. different format choices re: data/metadata/software associated with public/private/international collaborations

	* e.g. [NASA Earth Science Data Preservation Content Specification](https://cdn.earthdata.nasa.gov/conduit/upload/10607/NASA_ESD_Preservation_Spec.pdf)
		* NASA is not legislatively mandated to preserve data permanently and the specification does not say "how" to do this --- "The focus of this document is on the contents (i.e., “what”) and not on the implementation or representation (i.e., “how”) of the content items.")
		* What other examples are there?
