### Progress 

I submitted a proposal for review to the [London Institute for Space Policy and Law](https://ials.sas.ac.uk/about/leadership-and-collaboration/london-institute-space-policy-and-law-ispl). Hoping to eventually pursue a PhD through the University of London's [Institute of Advanced Legal Study](https://ials.sas.ac.uk/study).

...and now I wait.
