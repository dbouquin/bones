### Ideas for scope:

Simplify and send proposal to ISPL ([application](https://www.space-institute.org/app/uploads/1428674608_2015_visiting_scholar_researcher_application_10April2015.pdf))

#### Main objective:
Define "open satellite mission"

#### To be resolved: 
What characteristics of a satellite mission need to be evaluated to ensure openness?

#### Material to be generated:
Comprehensive analysis of existing relevant regulations and policies; enumeration of mission attributes that need to be assessed; case study applying results of the analysis

#### Why is it important?
Open science needs open space missions, but what "open" means is unclear. 

#### Relevant: 
FAIR data/software; OA policies (i.e. Plan S); OS licenses; U.S. Copyright; International IP laws; Regulations for private/public collaborations (space science context); Software preservation, etc.

#### Contribution: 
Survey of key features that determine how "open" a mission is - inform policy development and guidelines to further support/promote international collaboration; facilitate the adoption of practices that more easily allow people to share information and build on the work of others.

#### Study plan:
Mixed methods - combination of legal/policy and analysis + interviews to understand how normative behaviors and practices may influence interpretation and application of existing statutes and policies. Build on the research we're doing with the small sat community identifying and describing components of space missions and copyright/licensing in scholarly communication.

Side thoughts:

* Open software needs broad testing but you can catch the errors when software is open
	* [An Error in a Python Script May Have Invalidated 150+ Research Projects](https://medium.com/better-programming/an-error-in-a-python-script-may-have-invalidated-150-research-projects-64fe7cda558c)
		* "The error propagated depending on the operating system the scripts were being run on. The scripts were found to give accurate results on Windows 10 and macOS Mavericks but were less accurate by almost a full percent on macOS Mojave and Ubuntu." 
* CubeSat liability questions
	* Possible analogs to Boeing 373 MAX - case for the prosecution is difficult; if major problems arose from working with private company in small sat case how would it be approached?
