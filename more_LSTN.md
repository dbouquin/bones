#### tl;dr
Wolbach, LSF, MIT, NASA, and CPL will work together to develop instructions for a community build that can be tried out at CPL in April 2020. Instructions will be refined to support builds at other libraries. 
I would like to work together to develop a short “LSTN Handbook” to help with station setup and suggest initial educational activities and resources.
There’s a lot we could do after the pilot and I would like to start looking into funding opportunities to support post-pilot ideas. Thoughts welcome.

# LSTN Education

## LSTN Pilot: Resources and Activities
We plan to recommend specific activities and make a small set of resources available to support the pilot communities as they get started with their ground stations. Ideally we will have a short list of educational activities that could be undertaken throughout year two of the Sloan funding period (April 2020 - March 2021). Activities and resources should help communities take advantage of their stations, and inform further refinement of the MetaSat schema as implemented on SatNOGs and NASA systems. 

Documents will be made available online prior to builds planned for early spring 2020. LSTN web presence still needs to be established.

### LSTN Handbook
* Introduce library staff and community to the technology and SatNOGS DB
	* Likely adapt and build on the “Introduction to LSTN” document 
* Organized list of openly available resources on specific topics (e.g. NASA S3VI)
* FAQ about ground stations, small satellites
* Basic ground station maintenance and trouble-shooting
* Contact list
* Proposed Activities 
	* Description of recommended educational activities
		* Include a description of the anticipated learning outcomes
	* Links to related support materials

### Proposed Activities
Materials for each of these activities will be developed collaboratively and will be refined iteratively. Materials made available online should be screen readable. Learning outcomes need to be defined for each activity. We should make a deliberate effort to increase participation by people who are currently under represented in the small satellite community.

#### Ground station community build
* Wolbach will work with LSF and MIT to create an initial set of instructions for the build
	* Cambridge Public Library has agreed to work with us and be our first community build test case
		* We will do a “dry run” of the build before the community build
		* CPL community build should be timed to coincide with the Cambridge Science Festival (April 7-24, 2020)
			* CPL is interested in having LSF visit the library and give some kind of presentation and/or be present for part of the build
				* LSF can use Sloan funds to visit in April 2020
			* CPL also interested in having NASA visit or give remote presentation
				* Presentation could be given by Craig or another person to share what NASA is doing with small satellites and to share information about relevant databases
* Community build instructions should include information that can be shared about how each component works and information about how to learn more after the build
	* Handbook resources can be reused

#### Introduction to SatNOGS dashboards
* Choose a NASA mission as an example
	* Present goals of the mission, information about the people involved and the instruments
	* Give some background about the mission’s development and progress
		* Share NASA resources to find out more
* Teach how to interpret the dashboard
	* Teach key terminology
		* Introduction to the terminology on the dashboards will be a good opportunity to get feedback that could be incorporated into the schema and SatNOGS DB
* Define some tasks to try out with the dashboard and exercises to follow up on what was presented 
	* E.g. find out more about the satellite by going to the SatNOGS DB record; find out more about the mission from NASA mission pages

#### Introduction to mission artifacts
* Understanding waterfalls/imaging from SatNOGS DB
	* Converting sounds to images
		* Demo/introduction to tools
* Finding artifacts from past missions on NASA platforms
* Learning how to interpret and compare data from different relevant sources

#### Other ideas
* Introduction to amateur radio
* Science primers
	* Radio astronomy
	* Meteorology
	* Telecommunications

### Post-Pilot Possibilities
Following the pilot, we will have learned what worked and what failed, and what the communities find most valuable. The feedback we receive should shape the curriculum development goals and be incorporated into existing ideas for LSTN funding.

#### LSTN Ambassador program
LSTN Ambassadors could be librarians or other people interested in supporting a LSNT library. LSTN Ambassadors would go through an initial “train the trainer” program so they would be able to help troubleshoot ground station installations, support maintenance, and help if needed with some educational efforts. LSTN Ambassadors would sign up for a one year term and be willing to spend up to a few hours each month (or as needed) supporting a specific library community. LSTN Ambassadors would be required to help with the initial ground station build but mostly willing to just be a local support person if help is needed.

* Considerations
	* The LSTN Ambassador program could be part of another program already supported by NASA
		* NASA at my Library
		* Other NASA educational initiatives 
	* LSTN Ambassadors might be part of other amateur communities (e.g. radio) or connected to local universities
* Funding needed for:
	* “Train the Trainer” Curriculum development
	* Community coordinator
		* Paid position
* Group calling platform
* Small honorariums

#### LSTN Portal
Curriculum materials for all suggested pilot activities could be hosted on the portal along with an expanded set of curricular materials. This could also be a place to find out about the Ambassador program and resources provided by NASA, MIT, and others.	

* Considerations
	* Material on LSTN Portal should not duplicate materials that can be located elsewhere (should point to it instead)
	* Members of the LSTN community should be able to share materials they may have developed with other participants on the platform
	* Curation of the portal content would be on-going
* Funding needed for:
	* Curriculum development
	* Web development
	* Content curator - this might be a role the community coordinator can take on (?)
		* Paid position

#### Other ideas
* Science connections
  * We could put SatNOGS stations in remote locations where other types of research are being conducted (e.g Greenland, Hawaii) and create primers on the research being done in those locations.
    * Learn more about the work being done at other locations stations in the network
    * Scientists may be willing to provide educational material to the libraries about their work
* Translate all materials in different languages and braille
* Develop resources and tools to continually solicit public feedback on the MetaSat schema
