## [MetaSat](https://schema.space/) needs a future

### Tooling
Without tooling adoption will be really difficult. Fund developer time and/or Wolbach makes the things.

#### MetaSat-specific
* Form or some other tool for building MetaSat .jsonld files
  * Would need to allow people to select options (e.g. use schema.org or something else)
  * Different required vs. recommended elements for different core use cases
* Documentation for MetaSat implementation

#### General
* JSON-LD validator

### A crazy wonderful idea
Continuous development of the schema requires *continuous input and new use cases* ∴ tie further development of satellite technology directly to the schema: 

#### Sat Catalyst
"Sat Catalyst" would be a new project within the [Space Library](https://library.cfa.harvard.edu/space-library) that would build on both [MetaSat](https://schema.space/) and LSTN's motivations while supporting the development of new open space technologies.

Summary: Establish two pots of funding and one curatorial position within Wolbach Library. One pot of funding would be used to establish a group at the CfA -- this CfA group would vet scientific ideas at the start of a designated cycle, selects several, and then develop those ideas over a period of 1-2 years, to the point where they are ready to submit to a NASA, NSF, or another agency’s funding opportunity for flight construction and deployment (essentially the Small Sat Initiative proposed an idea like this for internal R&D funding but no luck). The second pot of funding would be set aside for groups external to the CfA who are already at the stage where they are looking for funding and ready to move forward. Funding from the two pots would be awarded to applicants on three conditions:
  1. Wolbach's Curator would be embedded in the project team to: capture metadata about the project; archive artifacts from the project; and define areas where the MetaSat schema needs to adapt.
  2. The project team openly licenses all artifacts resulting from the project and determines who to attribute the artifacts to (e.g. software, design files, white papers)
  3. The project team creates a short explainer about their project meant for the public and/or young audiences (this could be incorporated into educational materials for LSTN)
  
The external funding would be awarded to up to three groups who would be selected with input from the CfA group, Wolbach Library, and an external expert panel.

Estimated 3 years of funding needed to try this out (~1.5M)
Each year:
* CfA group - ~100K for scientific staff time and effort
* External pot - 300K (up to 100K per awardee)
* Metadata Curator - ~100K for salary, fringe/benefits, travel

Ideally CfA group is able to establish its value and get internal R&D funding after a few years and some measurable positive impact; External pot could potentially be replenished with a combination of internal funding and other external contributions; Curatorial position could be established as perminent and funded through the Smithsonian or Harvard and support preservation of complex digial objects/legacy software acquisitions. Curator could also take on tasks associated with expanding the schema's usecases and working with new groups (e.g. [rocketry](https://twitter.com/ORocketry/status/1189573186763005952?s=20) and making upstream contributions to other projects (e.g. [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q26540)).

### "Practical" lower cost ideas
Boring, but could keep the project viable.

1. 85K - 5 years of funding (~17K/year) for a Digital Projects Assistant (Temp position/internship for library grad students) to continually work with the the small sat community remotely - identify areas for improvement; create issues to track potential changes; assist in execution of projects related to schema development (e.g. simple tooling developed internally). 5 years would give enough time to finish digitization projects and/or cut some costs associated with journals to maybe make a $17K hole in our internal budget to keep the position going. Would limit our ability to expand use cases or quickly create tools but would ensure some progress beyond pilot phase.
2. 150K - 3 years of funding for a yearly workshop where stakeholders could come together to discuss new ideas for the schema and strategize ways to fund new tools and identify usecases

### A weird fun/peripheral idea
Could be linked to LSTN(?) - create a visualization interface to see all satellites in SatNOGS DB and create a 3D printed model of the earth. Touching the 3D printed model in a particular place would trigger audio that would tell you about satellites in the place where you touched. Could also just be an interface on a website but it would be an way to focus more on accessibility and to figure out what metadata would be needed to create adequate audio descriptions automatically.
